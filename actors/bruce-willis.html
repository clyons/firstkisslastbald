      <h3>💋 First Kiss — Unverified</h3>
      <p><strong>Film:</strong> <em>Blind Date</em> (1987)<br>
      <strong>Role:</strong> Walter Davis</p>

      <p>Oh my god, this is it. The moment young Bruce — baby-faced, twinkle-eyed, brimming with 80s mischief — leans in for that first on-screen kiss with Kim Basinger. You can feel the awkward charm radiating through the champagne haze, that perfect cocktail of nerves and swagger that only 1987 could pull off. It’s the dawn of a cinematic bad boy learning the language of love — one slightly tipsy kiss at a time.</p>

      <h3>🪮 Last With Hair — Unverified</h3>
      <p><strong>Film:</strong> <em>Death Becomes Her</em> (1992)<br>
      <strong>Role:</strong> Dr. Ernest Menville</p>
      <p>Behold… the final glory days of Bruce’s luscious locks. In <em>Death Becomes Her</em>, he still sports that soft, slightly tousled crown — just enough to run your fingers through before destiny (and genetics) took their course. He’s caught between Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn, dripping in nervous energy and tragic charm, but we know what’s really at stake: those final, flickering strands of hair history. Within a couple years, the shine wasn’t just on his head — it was on his legend.</p>
      <p>Know a later haired Bruce sighting? Submit it — we’re on follicle watch.</p>
