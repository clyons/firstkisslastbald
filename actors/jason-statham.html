    <h2>Filmography Follicle Facts</h2>
    <p>
      Jason Statham’s dossier finally has a confirmed entry: his first kiss, last bald moment combo
      hits hyperspeed in John Carpenter’s <em>Ghosts of Mars</em> (2001). The Red Planet romp delivers
      both the smooch and the shine in one neon-drenched package.

      <p>
        During the climactic train escape, Statham’s Sgt. Jericho Butler steals a desperate, dust-coated
        kiss with Lieutenant Melanie Ballard. It’s a quick spark in the middle of a Martian massacre, and it
        stands as his first on-screen lip-lock.

      <h3>Last Bald: Chrome Dome Combat</h3>
      <p>
        The same sequence doubles down on his trademark gleam. Helmet off, scalp reflecting the strobes, Butler
        wrestles possessed miners while the train barrels through Shining Canyon. It’s peak Statham: bald, brawling,
        and bathed in red light.
